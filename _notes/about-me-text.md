# About Me
Hi! My name is Atiyya Shahab. I’m a graphic designer in Chicago with an interest in digital experiences but also appreciates the beauty in print-based media. Many people consider design to be a right brained, intuitive discipline. However, I’ve been enjoying the harmony of both the logical and intuitive thinking behind design since 2006, when I starting designing and coding websites at the age of twelve. I’ve been honing my craft ever since. You can view my resume here.

## Design

Design is about problem solving with visual tools. Whether it's colors, typography, layout, imagery, and anything related to visual style, the success of a project often depends on it being well designed. Design is more than pushing pixels. It's a process of generating new ideas, testing them, and revising them.

## Illustration

After many years of playing and experimenting, I've developed a whimsical, children's-book-like illustration style that is most preferably expressed in alien form. I'm always looking to see where new  combinations of heads, eyes, arms, legs, and other limbs will take me. My work typically ends up in a bright vector-based colorful format, but I also enjoy drawing in black and white.
