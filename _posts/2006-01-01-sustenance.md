Sustenance is a juice bar and cafe in downtown Chicago focused on providing drinks, food, and snacks that are sustainable and plant-based. It's a great place to stop by and pick up something healthy, refreshing and nourishing to keep you active and ready to take on the day. The target audience are people who care about health, the environment, and ethics and enjoy the city life.

This is a student project and purely conceptual.
