Never Let Me Go is an experimental book project studying the relationship between text, icons, and how they interact together and independently. The objective of this project was to break the rules designers normally abide by and become comfortable with doing things that might be considered, "wrong" or "ugly," allowing oneself to create a truly dynamic and fresh design. The text starts off simple and well set, and slowly chaos consumes the layout.
