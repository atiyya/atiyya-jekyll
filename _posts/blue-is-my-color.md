Blue is My Color is a website for fine artist Mirjana Ursulesku who creates art in variety of mediums and styles. I designed the logo to add an organic element of nature with a leaf, but also made it concise enough to represent all her styles. The website was design to emphasize her variety of styles and allow her beautiful work to shine through. You can view the live site [here.](http://blueismycolor.com/)
