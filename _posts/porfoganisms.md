Portfoganisms is a concept I created for College of Dupageâ€™s Portfolio Night. I designed this poster with the target audience in mind of college age students, as well as high school students, to get them excited for the event. The characters represent the students who have been preparing all semester for the annual showcase of graphic design work. Through evolution, the students turned into Portfolio-making-machines.
