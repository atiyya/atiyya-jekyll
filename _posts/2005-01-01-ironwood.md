IronWood is an apartment building in New Hope, MN. I collaborated on this project with [UpShift Creative Group.](https://upshiftcreative.com/) This is one of three brand identities UpShift presented as an option. My role was in creating this identity option, but the logo and apartment name were created by other designers.
