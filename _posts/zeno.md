Zeno is a a publication filled with interviews of artists, designers, and other creative people. This design shows the grid to symbolize the creative process behind visual design. Please note that the illustrations in the interview spread are the work of [Zoe Persico](http://cargocollective.com/zoepersico), the artist I interviewed for the&nbsp;project.
