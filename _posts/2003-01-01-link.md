Link is an apartment building in the Lakeview neighborhood in Chicago. I collaborated on this project with [UpShift Creative Group.](https://upshiftcreative.com/) This is one of three brand identities UpShift presented as an option. My role was in creating this identity option, but the logo and apartment name were created by other&nbsp;designers.
