AM 1980 is an apartment building in the Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago. Collaborating with my Art Director and Senior Design, we named the building and presented three brand, look, and feel concepts for the client to pick from. This is the concept I created with [Upshift Creative Group](https://upshiftcreative.com/).
