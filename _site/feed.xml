        <title>Second Shift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Second Shift is a co-working space opening up in Logan Square in February 2017. They came to us to create an entirely new branding identity with accompanying materials, such as stationary, social media, advertisements and a website. After several iterations, we arrived at an identity that worked well for them. We handed the identity off with a standards manual so they could use their new identity consistently with all their materials. This was a collaborative project between myself, &lt;a href=&quot;http://williambartholomewgd.squarespace.com&quot;&gt;William Bartholomew&lt;/a&gt;, and Jasmine Howell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a real project done set up through my Columbia College Chicago’s Graphic Design practicum class.&lt;/p&gt;
