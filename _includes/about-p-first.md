Hi! My name is Atiyya Shahab. I'm a UX, UI & Graphic Designer in Chicago fascinated by digital experiences. Many people consider design to be a right brained, intuitive discipline. However, I've been enjoying the harmony of both the logical and intuitive thinking behind design since 2006, when I starting designing and coding websites at the age of twelve. I've been honing my craft ever since. You can view my <span style="white-space:nowrap">[resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf) here.</span>
